    <h2>CV:</h2>
<p>I am a tehcnology professional.</p>
    
<p>I started in IT, working at a small firm called Money Media.  There, 
    I ran the helpdesk for a busy newsroom serving the mutual fund industry.  
    The core of the business was an email newsletter (but not just any email newsletter - this one had
    great information in it!) and so I ran an SMTP server as well to deliver that document to the 
    inboxes of financial professionals. </p>
    
<p>
At Gawker, I was the first sys admin for a growing blog empire.  I moved them from a single shared host to a load-balanced
    cluster of hardened Linux machines.  I learned about security and BGP routing, building firewalls and high performance web 
    applications.
</p>
    
<p>I was also one of the first technical hires at Buzzfeed, working for the brilliant Jonah Peretti.  I built a trend forecasting 
    web crawler, which traversed the blogosphere using a markov chain analyzer to find new ideas.
    It didn't quite work but I am still proud of it.
</p>
    
<p>A friend and I came up with a brilliant idea that the standard m3u playlist format could be a list of URLs, and 
    the shareable playlist was born.  Out of that came Webjay, which was bought by Yahoo! and got me a job working 
    at the home of Rasmus Lerdorf, inventor of PHP.  By this time I was a full time software developer
</p>
    
<p>
I have recently worked at A+E Networks, as product owner for the 
sites for <a href="https://history.com">History</a>, <a href="https://mylifetime.com">Lifetime</a>, and <a href="https://aetv.com">A+E</a>.  
</p>
    
<p>
    I am also the creator of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/style/currents-throwaways-abandoned-on-the-curb-resurgent-on-the-internet.html">garbagescout</a>.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere:</h2>
<p>
I still share photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimn/">flickr</a>.  Mostly I use flickr to showcase the work I do 
    building custom bicycle frames.  I am an accomplished amateur frame builder, working mostly in lightweight fillet brazed steel.
    Frames that I have built have travelled across the USA, and have carried their riders 10s of 1000s of miles.
