<p><i>Only Compute.</i></p>

<p>I am a professional product manager, systems administrator, software developer and bicycle security consultant.  

I recently worked at  <a href="http://advertising.gawker.com/gawkermedia/">Gawker</a>, as a systems administrator, and have consulted there on and off since back when the whole thing was running on two servers.
Previously, I worked  at
 <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a>, developing social content management systems and custom web sites, and Caffry's, a nascent financial data firm.
 I was a perl developer at <a href="http://www.about.com/">About.com</a>, and worked on a social playlisting project called Webjay, within <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Music</a>, where I oversaw all aspects of integrating the project into the larger Yahoo! Music platform and vision. At <a href="http://buzzfeed.com">Buzzfeed</a> I designed and built a project to track trends by analyzing text from blogs.   I am also the creator of
<a href="http://inhabitat.com/garbage-scout/">garbagescout</a>.</p>
